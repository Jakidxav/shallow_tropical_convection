Welcome to this repository! In it, you will find files related to shallow convection in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, and how that influences deeper convection in the West Pacific. This project was done at the University of Washington with the help and guidance of Dennis Hartmann.

Because there are a number of files, I have suggested an order in which I think the Jupyter Notebooks should be run:
- seasonal_mass_flux
- xarray_annual_cycle
- hovmoller
